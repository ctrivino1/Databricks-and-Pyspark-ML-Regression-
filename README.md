# Databricks-and-Pyspark-ML-Regression-
This repository is meant for users using the Databricks enviornment. The above file is a ".dbc", meaning that you need to use databricks in order to access the files that are contained within. Thankfully there is a free community version of Databricks that anyone can download and from which you can access the files found in the dbc file in this repo. 

The data comes from New Brunswick, Canada's 2021 Airbnb data. This data set can be found on Airbnb's website http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html . Here you can download a number of of datasets. The file I used was New Brunswick, Canada's .gz file. This file contains the raw data from which we clean up and perform machine learing on. The data will probably be more updated when you download the data set from the website. Most of the models are just baseline models because my Free Azure account with Databricks expired haha, and it started taking a while on the free community version.

### Note: This is dbc file assumes that you understand Python, SQL, Pyspark, and machine learning. You will probably have to look up what some functions are doing. This should hopefully be a great teaching tool to show how to do ML(machine Learning) in Pyspark/Databricks. 

(The code is primarily Pyspark, but there is some python/SQL involved)
skills you'll learn with the dbc file:

* Data cleaning
* Creating Random Forest models 
* Creating Gradient Boosting models
* Creating an Artifical Neural Newtork
* Databricks ML flow trackiing system (Definilty you will have to look up. But in short stores models, parameters, and metrics)
* Databricks hyper opt library optimization
* How to save a data to delta Lake

#### In the future I would like to find a way to show how to use shapely charts with Pyspark models. Shapely charts are very powerful in explaining a ML model. I will work on updating my notebooks.
